# Neo6502

Some experiments playing with the Neo6502 from https://www.olimex.com.

To build, first install the `pico-sdk` as per [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf).

Then per project, e.g. `sound`:

```
$ cd sound
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
